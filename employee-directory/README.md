<h1>Employee Directory with React</h1>

<h2>Project Details</h2>
<p>This dynamically updating react application allows a user to view their entire employee directory at once. Data is fetched from the "https://randomuser.me/" API, where a random 10 results are generated on the home screen. This application's UI is broken up into different components that are managed by state and respond to user events.<br> A search box allows a user to search for an employee by name, and a "filter" button that filters the data by gender. <br> Additional buttons and sorting by name are for future development.</p>

<p>To start the server, clone the repository to your local desktop, run: "npm install" to download project dependencies, followed by "npm start" to launch the application in the local browser</p>
